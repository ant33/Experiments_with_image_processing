Here is realisation of some simple methods of edge detection:
1. edge detection by treshold (using gradient of gray picture)
2. Marr-Hildreth's method
Also:
1. Numerical solution of heat equation with free boundary condition.
2. Perona-Malik method
3. Modification of Merona-Malik method (divergence of convolution * grad)
